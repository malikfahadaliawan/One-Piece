      <h2>
        <p>One piece</p>
      </h2>
    </strong>
  </em>

  <p>Now One piece is one of the top Shonen anime's and by far the best I have ever seen in my life. Basically the story of this anime revolves around a kid <strong>"Monkey D. Luffy"</strong> who has extra ordinary abilities and wants to become <strong>"The King of Pirates"</strong>.
    Along in his journey there are so many adventures that anyone can ever imagine, and along these adventures he keeps making friends and enemies.</p>

  <em>
    <h3>Captain and his first crew member</h3>
  </em>
  <p>The most important thing that <strong> "The King of Pirates"</strong> will need is the strongest <strong>crew</strong> of them all. So Luffy as trying to be a captain starts to look for strong members of the crew and that is where he runs into and saves my favorite character of One Piece <strong>"Zoro"</strong>.He was about to get executed by a corrupt officer of navy but then he is saved by luffy. The best part that I love about zoro is that he uses three swords in a battle. One in his right hand, one in his left hand and the last one is held side ways between his teeths, in his mouth. </p>
  <h3><em><strong>Crew</strong></em></h3>
  <ul>
    <strong>Captain</strong>
    <p>
      <li>The captain of the Straw hats is <strong> Monkey D. Luffy </strong>. He is a very simple-minded boy. His ambition is to become <strong>"The King of Pirates"</strong>. He ate a devil fruit called <strong>"Gum-Gum Fruit"</strong>. Other than his crazy sense for adventure, love and care for his friends and crew, he is totally no captain material. </li>
    </p>
  </ul>

His Dream is to Find <strong> "All Blue" </strong>. It is the Ocean which contains all the sea creatures in itself.
