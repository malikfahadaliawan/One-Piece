  <p><em><strong> Grandfather of Luffy </strong></em>
    <a href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Monkey_D._Garp">Monkey D. Garp</a> is the Grandfather of Luffy. He is way different than his family that's because he is a <strong> vice admiral </strong> of the Navy. He is the one to raise Luffy. He always punished him because luffy always wanted to become a Pirate and he didn't want that.

  <p><em><strong> Brother of Luffy </strong></em>
    <a href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Portgas_D._Ace">"Firefist" Portgas D. Ace</a> is the brother of Luffy. They are not biological brothers but they shared a cup of Japanese rice wine (Sake, In japanese tradition if two share a cup of sake and swear a oath then they become brothers. This is how they became brothers.) He is the son of Gold D. Roger. But never liked him. That is the reason of why Ace changed his family name and picked his mother's family name <strong>Portgas</strong>.
